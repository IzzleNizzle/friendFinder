## What does it do?

In this app you can answer a magical survey and you will be shown the results of another person whose personality is most likely to be compatible with yours.

:boom:

## How does it work? :confused:

1. You fill out the magical survey and we analyze your personaly traits.

2. We search our database for other users and respond with the most compatible match!

3. You are then amazed and shocked at how accurate our matching process is as you gaze into the eyes of your one true love.

## What technologies are used?

I am using a mixture of;

* nodeJS for the backend server
* Express for API and HTML Route Handling
* Html and CSS for the webpages you see
* jQuery for AJAX Calls to interact with my servers API routes

## Where can I find it? :question:
